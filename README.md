# Coming later in 2018

While I am interested in releasing the source code as soon as possible, it requires some cleaning up and some testing. Unfortunately, I will not be able to perform this in the next few month due to my workload. I am currently hoping to have a release ready by mid-2018.

Please note that a previous version of the software (as described in the ECCV 2012 paper) is available here: https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/image-localization
